# Security Implementation Examples

This directory contains example code for implementing security best practices in different frameworks and platforms.

## Available Examples

1. **Next.js** - Security implementations for Next.js web applications
2. **React Native** - Security implementations for React Native mobile applications

Each subdirectory contains a README.md file with specific instructions and explanations for that platform.

## Using These Examples

These code samples are provided as reference implementations rather than copy-paste solutions. You should:

1. Understand the security concepts being demonstrated
2. Adapt the examples to your specific application architecture
3. Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
4. Test the security of your implementation

## Important Note

Security is a moving target - best practices evolve as new vulnerabilities are discovered. Always:

- Stay updated with the latest security recommendations
- Follow the framework's official security documentation
- Regularly audit and update your security implementations
